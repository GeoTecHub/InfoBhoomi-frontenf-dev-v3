# Code Formatting Guide

To ensure consistency in our codebase and avoid merge conflicts, please follow these steps for setting up and using Prettier in VS Code.

## 1. Install the Prettier Extension

- In VS Code, go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
- Search for: "Prettier - Code formatter" by Esben Petersen
- Click "Install".

---

## 2. Update VS Code Settings

1. Go to: **File → Preferences → Settings**
2. In the Settings search bar, type `format on save`.
   - Under **Text Editor > Formatting**, check the box for **Format On Save**.
3. In the search bar, type `default formatter`.
   - Under **Text Editor > Formatting: Default Formatter**, select `Prettier - Code formatter esbenp.prettier-vscode` from the dropdown.

This will ensure VS Code automatically formats your files using Prettier every time you save.

## 3. Before Every Commit

**Before committing your changes, please follow these steps to ensure your code is properly formatted:**

1. Open the VS Code "Terminal".
2. Run the following command to automatically format your code:

    npm run format
    
3. After formatting, run the following command to check for any remaining formatting issues:

    npm run format:check

If `npm run format:check` reports no issues, you can safely commit your changes.
